I'm zxkmm (but you can also call me sommermorgentraum or just zix). I'm a wireless and cybersecurity researcher who's basically obsessed with SDRs, wireless security, and embedded development.

# What I'm Building

I spend much time coding on various projects - both my own projects and contributing to other community-driven projects. For several of these, I'm a core contributor and/or core maintainer.

- **[HackRF-PortaPack-Mayhem](https://github.com/portapack-mayhem/mayhem-firmware)** - A powerful portable SDR that lets you test/hack many wireless systems on the go.
- **[SiYuan](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)** - An personal knowledge management tool that works everywhere.
- **[My SiYuan plugins](https://github.com/stars/zxkmm/lists/my-siyuan-plugins)** - They are good quality and well known.
- **[My RF research projects](https://github.com/stars/zxkmm/lists/my-rf-research-projects)** - Cool toys.

# When I'm Not Coding

## Music
I'm a classical music nerd - piano sonatas and symphonies are my jam. I also play piano and dabble with violin (emphasis on "dabble" for the violin part!).

## Cooking
When I'm not breaking wireless systems, I'm probably in the kitchen! I love making both Chinese and American cuisine.
